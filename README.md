# Calcatro
This repository contains the source code and compiled binary for a Ti 84+ CE adopted version of [Balatro](https://playbalatro.com/) game developed for the TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator using the [CEdev](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/) toolchain. The game is written in C and compiled to run natively on the calculator.

---

Use TI Connect CE to put the `CALCATRO.8xp` file found in the `bin` directory on the calculator. Add the `clibs.8xg` file also if you do not have them already. Use a shell like [Cesium](https://github.com/mateoconlechuga/cesium/tree/v3.7.0) to run the game.
